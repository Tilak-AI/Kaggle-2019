# Kaggle: Analysis on ML and Data Science survey of 2019 and India Presence

This repository has a Jupyter notebook that I have created to find out my analysis on Kaggle's Machine Learning and Data Science Survey from 2019. The data source can be fetched [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019). I have also written a blog on Medium wiht my detailed anlysis. The same can be access via clicking [here](hhttps://medium.com/@tgpath18/kaggle-analysis-on-ml-and-data-science-survey-2019-and-india-presence-b4ddc8015e01).
